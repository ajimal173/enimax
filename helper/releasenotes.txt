1. Fixed a few bugs.
2. Added more meta data to 9anime and gogoanime -- like thumbnails, titles, dates, etc.
3. When a show is added to "Ongoing", it will tell you on the homepage when the next episode will air, if that info is available.
4. You can now swipe right on most pages to navigate back.
5. Improved the player's slide down transition.
6. Twitch vods are treated like a livestream, so it automatically updates the video without having to reload (a really good QoL change imo).
7. Fixed fmovies
8. Added timeouts to notifications
9. Automated a whole bunch of CI/CD stuff.

Onto the major features:

10. Added episode list to the player
11. Added manga!!: All you need to do is go to search, select mangafire/mangadex as the source and search. It will automatically redirect you to the mangareader. You can also download mangas, which is fricking awesome. I plan on improving the manga reader too.
